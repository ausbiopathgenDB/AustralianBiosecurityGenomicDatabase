## Introduction 
The Australian Biosecurity Genomic Database is a curated collection of viral reference genomes based on the [National Notifiable Disease List of Terrestrial Animals] and the [National List of Reportable Diseases of Aquatic Animals]. The database is provided as a FASTA file that can be used to screen high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data generated from animals, animal products, or environmental samples.  

The latest version of the database contains 88 viruses, representing 33 viral families. Sequences were acquired from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Nucleotide database, using high-quality whole genome reference sequences from RefSeq where possible. Each virus species was represented by a single isolate and segmented genomes were merged so that each virus was represented by a single sequence.
