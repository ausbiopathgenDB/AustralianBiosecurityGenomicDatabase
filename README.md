## Introduction 
The Australian Biosecurity Genomic Database is a curated collection of viral reference genomes based on the [National Notifiable Disease List of Terrestrial Animals]. The database is provided as a FASTA file that can be used to screen high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data generated from animals, animal products, or environmental samples.  

The initial version of the database contains 57 viruses, representing 21 viral families, as shown in this [Krona chart]. Sequences were acquired from the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Nucleotide database, using high-quality whole genome reference sequences from RefSeq where possible. Each virus species was represented by a single isolate and segmented genomes were merged so that each virus was represented by a single sequence.
